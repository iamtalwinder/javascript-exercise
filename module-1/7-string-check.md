# String checks

---

**1) Design a function that checks if a given string starts and ends with the same character.**

Example Input: "apple"
Example Output: "Yes, it starts and ends with the same character."

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: You can access characters in a string using indices, just like in arrays.
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function be case-insensitive?

Example Input: "Alaska"
Example Output: "Yes, it starts and ends with the same character."

---

**2) Write a function that determines if a string contains any spaces.**

Example Input: "hello world"
Example Output: "The string contains spaces."

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Consider using the `includes` method available for strings.
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function also count how many spaces are present in the string?

Example Input: "This is an example."
Example Output: "The string contains 3 spaces."

---

**3) Create a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters which reads the same backward or forward).**

Example Input: "radar"
Example Output: "The string is a palindrome."

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: You might want to reverse the string and compare it with the original.
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function ignore spaces and punctuation while checking for palindromes?

Example Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
Example Output: "The string is a palindrome."

---

**4) Design a function that accepts a string and returns the number of vowels present in it.**

Example Input: "Hello"
Example Output: "The string contains 2 vowels."

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Consider iterating through each character of the string and checking if it's a vowel.
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function also return the vowels found in the string?

Example Input: "Opulent"
Example Output: "The string contains 3 vowels: O, u, e."
