**1) Design a function that accepts a score out of 100. If the score is 90 and above, classify it as "A". If the score is between 80 and 89, classify it as "B". If it's between 70 and 79, it's "C". Below 70 is "D".**

Example Input: 85
Example Output: "B"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Begin by checking if the score meets the "A" criteria. If not, move on to check the next set of criteria for "B", and so forth.
</details>

Follow-up: Can you also provide feedback on each grade?

Example Input: 72
Example Output: "C - Good job, but there's room for improvement."

**2) Create a function that takes in a day of the week. If it's Monday, return "Start of the workweek". If it's Wednesday, return "Midweek". If it's Friday, return "Weekend is near!". For any other day, return "Regular Day".**

Example Input: "Wednesday"
Example Output: "Midweek"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Start by checking each specific day that has a unique message. If none of them match, use the else clause for "Regular Day".
</details>

Follow-up: For the weekend days (Saturday and Sunday), can the function suggest a leisure activity?

Example Input: "Saturday"
Example Output: "Weekend - Maybe go for a hike?"

**3) Write a function that accepts an animal name. If it's "Dog", return "Bark". If it's "Cat", return "Meow". If it's "Cow", return "Moo". For any other animal, return "Unknown Sound".**

Example Output: "Bark"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Check each animal name and return its respective sound. If the input doesn't match any known animal, use the else clause.
</details>

Follow-up: If the animal is a "Bird", can the function also specify the sound as "Chirp"?

Example Input: "Bird"
Example Output: "Chirp"
