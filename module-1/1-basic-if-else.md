# Basic if-else

---

**1) Write a function to determine if a given number is even or odd.**

Example Input: 5
Example Output: "Odd"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Use the modulus operator (%).
</details>

Follow-up: Can you determine if it's a positive even or odd number?

Example Input: -4
Example Output: "Negative Even"

---

**2) Create a function that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.**

Example Input: -15
Example Output: "Negative"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Use basic comparisons.
</details>

Follow-up: Can you determine if it's a large negative or small negative number (e.g., less than -1000 is large negative)?

Example Input: -1500
Example Output: "Large Negative"

---

**3) Write a function that checks the temperature and determines if it's hot, warm, cool, or cold.**

Example Input: 25
Example Output: "Warm"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Consider defining ranges for each category, e.g., hot (>30°C), warm (20°C - 30°C), cool (10°C - 20°C), and cold (<10°C).
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function also advise on the type of clothing to wear for each temperature range?

Example Input: 8
Example Output: "Cold. Wear a heavy jacket."

Certainly! Here are three additional problems focusing on basic if-else constructs, complete with example input and output:

---

**4) Write a function that checks if a given word is "short" (less than 5 characters), "medium" (5 to 7 characters), or "long" (more than 7 characters).**

Example Input: "apple"
Example Output: "Short"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Use the string's `length` property to get its size.
</details>

Follow-up: Can the function also suggest a synonym based on the length of the word?

Example Input: "magnificent"
Example Output: "Long. Consider using 'great' as a synonym."

---

**5) Create a function that evaluates the speed of a vehicle and determines if it's "slow" (below 30km/h), "average" (between 30km/h and 60km/h), or "fast" (above 60km/h).**

Example Input: 45
Example Output: "Average"

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Hint: Use simple comparison operators for evaluating the speed.
</details>

Follow-up: Based on the speed, can the function also advise on safety measures?

Example Input: 70
Example Output: "Fast. Ensure you're wearing your seatbelt and following road signs."
